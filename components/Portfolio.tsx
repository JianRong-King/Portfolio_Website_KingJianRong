      "Collaborated with a team of three to design and implement a 2D game featuring multiple characters, items, locations, and time-based gameplay elements. Applied OOP principles (SOLID, DRY) to ensure a scalable, maintainable architecture with emphasis on future extensibility. Reduced module dependencies through abstraction layers (interfaces, abstract classes) and implemented dependency injection to decouple object behaviors, enabling flexible modular functionality.",
